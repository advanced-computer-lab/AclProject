## Description
The website is designed to recreate a flight booking experience where the user can go from selecting a flight they want to
reserve to choosing the seats they want from the available seats that are shown to them to confirming their flight and paying
for them with their debit/credit card.

If the user is logged in as an administator then they have the ability to create/edit/delete any flight they want to.

The user also has the ability to sign up in order to have their data stored in order to book any flight the want if they are
visiting the website as a guest.

The user can also check their reserved flight as well as change any criteria they do not like form changing the seats that they
chose to changing the whole flight from beginning to end, also they can cancel their flight simply and get their money back.

## Motivation
The reason behind this project is creating a full working flightbooking website with every feature 
needed to ensure a satisfying experience for all the users with minimal effort.

## Build Status
The code fully works and does not contain any bugs/errors.
